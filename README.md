# Fasham_Model_GroupProject
We constructed a Fasham model to explore the development of phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, bacteria, and various forms of dissolved nitrogen through time in the Artic Ocean. We applied this model for a baseline scenario of six months of sea ice cover and for two climate change scenarios of four months and two months of sea ice.  The aim of the project was to estimate how much carbon sinks into the sediment (and is thus sequestered) under those climate scenarios.  We conclude that carbon sequestration will slightly decrease if the duration of sea  ice is reduced, however production of zooplankton would increase substantially, which  provide more food for higher trophic levels, and potentially a higher fisheries yield.
