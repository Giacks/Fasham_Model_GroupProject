# Fasham_Model_GroupProject
We constructed a Fasham model to explore the development of phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, bacteria, and various forms of dissolved nitrogen through time in the Artic Ocean. The aim of the project was to estimate how much carbon sinks into the sediment (and is thus sequestered) under different scenarios of sea ice cover.
